## 1. Pivot Strategy
We shifted from a "Cyberpunk Portfolio" to a **"Digital Software Store"**.
- **Inspiration:** Gumroad, Raycast, Lemonsqueezy.
- **Goal:** Make the user feel they are entering a marketplace of trusted tools, not a developer's personal site.

## 2. Updated Prompt (Storefront V1)
> "Redesign the homepage for 'BitNomade' as a **Software Digital Store/Studio**.
> Key Structural Changes:
> 1. **Product-First Hero:** High-quality mockup collage of the 4 tools. H1: 'Software de Alto Impacto para Negocios Digitales'. CTA: 'Explorar Catálogo'.
> 2. **The Storefront (Grid):** A clean 2x2 grid section titled 'Best Sellers'. Each card looks like a product box with Price Tag and 'Get' button.
> 3. **Why Us Section:** Icons for 'Privacy First', 'One-Time Payment', 'Unified Support'.
> 4. **Trust Footer:** Simple links to Support/Docs."

## 3. Design Outcome
The new generated screen (ID: `204020939c984d25896978e24f3f1bf4`) features:
- **Marketplace Aesthetic:** Clean product cards with clear pricing and "Get" buttons.
- **Focus on Transaction:** The UI is designed to drive downloads/purchases, not just "contact".
- **Professional Trust:** The "Why Us" section reinforces the business model (One-time payment vs subscriptions).

## 4. Implementation Notes
- When building the HTML, use `CSS Grid` for the product cards to ensure they look like a catalog.
- Use `Flexbox` for the "Why Us" icons to keep them aligned horizontally.
- The "Get" buttons should link directly to the Chrome Web Store or Stripe Checkout.
